#### An animated avatar that responds to text fields interactions üêª

![Demo gif](/assets/demo.gif)

Inspired by the amazing work done by other designers and developers, I wanted to create an animated "Login avatar" in Swift.

My idea was to use a couple `UIPropertyAnimator` and `fractionComplete` to simplify the animation. As the user types, I update the animator's fraction complete based on the `text width / text field width`.

The avatar has a neutral, active, ecstatic, and shy state.

Questions? Comments? I would love to hear your feedback, thanks. :heart:
